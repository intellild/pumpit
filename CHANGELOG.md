# pumpa

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- bbb3f6b: Rename all the files and code from "Pumpa" to "PumpIt", since NPM doesn't allow
  me to use "Pumpa" as it is too similar to "pump" package.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2af26f2: Add option for custom data to be passed to the `beforeResolve` and `afterResolve` callbacks.
